                    Chapter 1 of *Animal Farm* is the literary blueprint for the **Russian Revolution**. Old Major, the revered pig, represents **Karl Marx**, the German philosopher whose theories form the basis of Communism, known in the novel as 'Animalism'. Just as Major critiques Farmer Jones's oppressive regime, Marx's philosophy emerged as a response to the miserable conditions of the working class under autocratic and capitalistic rule.

                <p class="text-sm italic text-gray-500 mb-4">
                    Before the 1917 Revolution, Russia was ruled by Tsar Nicholas II (paralleling the incompetent Farmer Jones). His regime was marked by violence, economic neglect, and social unrest. Millions of peasants and factory workers suffered under terrible conditions and low wages while the royal family and wealthy landowners lived in luxury. The Tsar's disastrous decisions, particularly dragging Russia into unpopular wars, mirrored Jones's drunkenness and neglect, creating the perfect environment for a desperate, revolutionary uprising among the oppressed masses.

                <p class="text-sm italic text-gray-500 mb-4">
                    The ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which form the basis of Communism, are often allegorized through Old Major's principles. This excerpt directly addresses the conflict between the oppressed working class (proletariat) and the owning class (bourgeoisie).
